=head1 DESCRIPTION

This binary is a consumer of L<Syntax::Check>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Binary:

    syncheck [--verbose] [--keep] [--ext=path/ext/package.pm] [--inc=/lib/path] perl_filename.ext

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=head2 --keep|-k

If supplied, we will keep the temporary library directory structure in your
temp dir. By default we delete this directory upon program completion.

=head2 --verbose|-v

Supply this argument to get verbose output.

=head2 --ext=path/ext/package.pm

Optional. When it's set then content of that file will be interpreted as part of main package. 
As perl allows keep many packages in the same file that helps you have a deal with:

=over 4

=item *

constant exported from uninstalled packages

=item *

functions (even with protothypes) exported from uninstalled packages

=item *

custom artifacts

=back

=head2 --inc=/lib/path

Optional. It defines an additional library path. This is L<options with multiple values|Getopt::Long/"Options-with-multiple-values">

=head2 perl_file.ext

This argument is mandatory and must follow all others. It's the name of the
Perl file to do syntax checking on.
